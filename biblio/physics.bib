	for this task, a more efficient semiclassical version can be used,
	for which only single-qubit operations conditioned on measurement
	outcomes are required. We apply the transform to several input states
	of different periodicities; the results enable the location of peaks

	the key elements of a scalable ion-trap architecture, suggesting

  school = {University of Oxford},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {This thesis describes experimental and theoretical work aimed at development
	of an ion
	
	trap quantum information processor. The experimental work is concerned
	with the control
	
	and manipulation of quantum states of one and two 40Ca+ ions, and
	includes the implementation
	
	of a two-qubit logic gate between two trapped ions. Tomography was
	used
	
	to obtain elements of the density matrix, from which we can deduce
	that a maximally
	
	entangled state of the ions‚Äô spin was created with 83% fidelity.
	
	In order to implement the quantum logic gate, the ion-light interaction
	needs to be well
	
	understood, and a high level of control over the spin and motional
	states is required. The
	
	experimental work described in this thesis represents advances in
	both these areas. We
	
	have demonstrated ground state cooling, preparation of superpositions
	of Fock and coherent
	
	states of motion, and measured the lowest heating rate and longest
	motional coherence
	
	times observed in an ion trap. We have also experimentally studied
	spin decoherence in
	
	the context of qubit memory and logic gate infidelity.
	
	A single trapped ion was used to thoroughly investigate the state-dependent
	force used
	
	for the two-ion logic gate. These experiments created the largest
	mesoscopic superpositions
	
	of motional states yet observed in an ion trap. The motion was entangled
	with the spin of
	
	the ion, creating states analogous to those considered in the ‚ÄúSchr¬®odinger‚Äôs‚Äù
	cat thought
	
	experiment. The measured coherence times for these states were an
	order of magnitude
	
	longer than those reported elsewhere.
	
	The theoretical work included in this thesis is a study of the design
	of ion traps optimised
	
	for fast separation of trapped ions. We provide insights into the
	important characteristics
	
	of the trapping potential during separation, and compare a range of
	electrode
	
	geometries. Ion separation is a key issue in scaling up ion trap quantum
	information

	Long coherence times in the external motional states are essential

	which has not previously been used as a trapped-ion qubit, is about
	one thousand times longer than that of physical qubits based on \Ca{40}
	ions. Using a single spin-echo pulse to ``re-phase'' the internal

	coherence time $T_2^{\mbox{\tiny SE}} \gtish 45\s$. This compares

  abstract = {This article discusses the intimate relationship between quantum mechanics,
	information theory, and relativity theory. Taken together these are
	the foundations of present-day theoretical physics, and their interrelationship
	is an essential part of the theory. The acquisition of information
	from a quantum system by an observer occurs at the interface of classical
	and quantum physics. The authors review the essential tools needed
	to describe this interface, i.e., Kraus matrices and positive-operator-valued
	measures. They then discuss how special relativity imposes severe
	restrictions on the transfer of information between distant systems
	and the implications of the fact that quantum entropy is not a Lorentz-covariant
	concept. This leads to a discussion of how it comes about that Lorentz
	transformations of reduced density matrices for entangled systems
	may not be completely positive maps. Quantum field theory is, of
	course, necessary for a consistent description of interactions. Its
	structure implies a fundamental tradeoff between detector reliability
	and localizability. Moreover, general relativity produces new and
	counterintuitive effects, particularly when black holes (or, more
	generally, event horizons) are involved. In this more general context
	the authors discuss how most of the current concepts in quantum information
	theory may require a reassessment.},

  abstract = {We investigate the region of validity of the semiclassical approach
	to simulating laser cooling. We conclude that for the commonly used
	pi(x) pi(y) polarization-gradient configuration, the semiclassical
	approach is valid only for transitions with recoil parameters epsilon(r),
	on the order of 10(-4) or less. For the standard laser-cooling transitions
	only the transitions in Rb and Cs satisfy this condition. For the
	Doppler and sigma(+)sigma(-) polarization-gradient configuration
	the semiclassical approach is valid for most of the commonly used
	transitions; however, the expected gain in execution speed compared
	with quantum Monte Carlo calculations has been realized only in part.
	A drastic reduction in calculation time is to be expected by implementing
	an analytical approach to the long-term contribution of the diffusion
	coefficient. (c) 2005 Optical Society of America.},

	scale promises even higher levels of control and reliability. Compared
	with 'chip traps' for confining neutral atoms, ion traps with similar
	dimensions and power dissipation offer much higher confinement forces
	and allow unparalleled control at the single-atom level. Moreover,
	ion microtraps are of great interest in the development of miniature

	large-scale quantum information processors. Here we report the operation

	semiconductor micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology.
	We confine, laser cool and measure heating of a single 111Cd+ ion
	in an integrated radiofrequency trap etched from a doped gallium-arsenide

	80 Hz, corresponding to a fractional frequency resolution of 1.2√ó10-13.
